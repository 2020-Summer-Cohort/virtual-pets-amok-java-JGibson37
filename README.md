# Virtual Pet Shelter

This project presented a lot of challenges when dealing with ArrayList. I began by creating basic classes and methods 
using TDD principles. Eventually I had to break away because I did not know how to test my numerous usage of iterating
through the array. I did ask a friend for some help, and we implemented a more advanced concept to parse my inheritances
more flexibly when displaying the list. Developing the app was easier than expected as the challenges I faced developing
it I was able to more readily solve by myself. After finishing out the app, I went back and attempted to create more 
unit tests for the information I had created without them. Some tests remain unfinished as I plan to learn how to test
those methods properly and return to the project.
